Ted Talks
---------

With every afternoon meal, I watch a Ted talk to improve myself, learn from others and broaden my perspective for different things. Following is a post session summary I could remember. The choice of the Talk is completely random.
Please refrain yourself from making anything out of this summary (or better this place). 

**Read at your own risk**

## 2019.03.07 (20) Why I love a country that once betrayed me - George Takei
- Speaker being a japanese american had to go to prison after Japan bombed Pearl harbour during World War 1
- Prison was in very isolated place somewhere in Arkansas
- Japanese americans were called "non-alient" which means citizen in negative
- Children are amazingly adaptable and he as a kid quickly adapted to the situations in prison
- After an year of imprisonment and when world war ended, they were released to go wherever they want in America
- When the family went to Los Angeles, it was not very welcoming. There were drunkyards, smell of urine everywhere
- Their homes were taken and they had to start everything again
- Speaker read history and civics books to learn more about the imprisonment
- His father helped him learn the democracy - It is about the people. It can as good as good people in goveranance and can be as fallible as the bad guys. Democracy means governance by people.
- After the bombing of pearl harbour, young americans (including japanese americans) voluteered to fight for their country but instead japanese americans were sent to imprisonment
- When there was a shortage of man power in war, japanese american were asked to join and they did join to take their families out of prison and for their own country
- During a battle with Germany, they did not expect an attack from the opposite of a hill which was 1000 ft high and Americans were losing so the 442nd Unit (containing japanese americans) decided to hike the hill and attack from the back to surprise the germans
- Some did die due to slipping hand/foot but in silence to keep their plan intact
- They hiked for 8 hours and with the first light they attacked and won in 32 minutes
- When they came back, the president said "You did not win only a war but prejudice"

## 19) How to teach kids to talk about taboo topics - Liz Kleinrock
- Speaker is a classroom teacher of 4th grade students
- Once a kid asked - What is racism
- Another kid volunteered and answered white skin people do not respect dark skin people because the colour of their skin matches the color of poop
- Half of the class burst into laughter while the other half started making comments how can she say something like this. This is offensive.
 - Teacher had two options
 	* Fight: Scold the kid who answered and suppress her voice
 	* Flight: Change the subject
 - Both the options were bad for one or the other
 	* Fight is bad for Abby because she did not know what wrong she said and she will not gather courage to say something she knew next time
 	* Flight is bad for half of the class who laughed listeneing to word poop and may associate this in their later period of life
 - So, Instead she choose to explain the topic and the whole classes expressed interest in understanding it and why it is wrong
 - We should develop an ecosystem where kids should be free to make mistakes, learn from them and can communicate with each other about different things
 - We as adults should not be embarassed about not knowing something. If they ask something you don't know admit it and respond later

## 18) The meaning of work - Roy Bahat
- Startup Invester in AI field
- People with less than 150K salary said about the work
	* Dignity
	* Stability
- We always needed one another in our work
- Future is already here. When ATM machines were installed, essentially it has replaced jobs for cash dispensers in banks but it has also created jobs in other domains
- Some people who work but are not get paid like caretakers, parents, housewives. They also deserve dignity.
- We need to stop associating dignity with paid jobs.
- Even 100 years from now in work we will need collaboration with others
- For some truck drivers, they have dignity because they are the ones bringing fruits, vegetables, newspapers to everyone in the city

## 17) Saving for tomorrow, tomorrow - Shlomo Benartzi
- An average american spends approx 1000 dollars every year on lotteries
- Primarily low income people spend more on lotteries than high salaried guys
- People always choose to spend now vs save for later. Immediate gratification wins
- People buy house more than they can afford and couldn't pay mortgages and blame banks
- About 0.5% of americans save too much in 401K scheme
- Less than 30% of americans save in 401K scheme
	* Rest of them either don't decide to or couldn't affort to save
- Organ Donation Example
	* In Germany people can select to donate organs when they fill DL and other forms. About 12% do
	* In Austria, people can select NOT to donate organs and about 1% do.
	* This means, Germany has ~12% donors while Austria has ~99% donors
	* This shows, the result of doing nothing. Procastination
- Banana vs Chocolate experiment
	* Given a choice of banana vs chocolate in an event next week, studies showed that 74% people preferred bananas but actually in the event 25-30% actually ate bananas. More people went with chocolate because of immediate gratification
- Money Apple Experiment
	* A group of monkeys is given an apple and they were really happy
	* Another group of monkeys is given two apples and one is taken away and they become really mad why the second one was taken away
	* Similarly, when we have received money it is difficult for us to avoid this and go to savings
	* Another challenge, notion of loss aversion. Somehow we feel that saving is some kind of loss for us
- Speaker and his friend (Richard Thaler) combined all these studies and results and created a scheme for financial planning
- They created Retirement Pension Plan according to which 3% additional amount will go to employee's savings whenever they get a pay raise.
- This inceased the amount of savings and people starting to save more.
- Lots of companies have adopted this scheme.

## 16) Spend 10 minutes a day doing nothing - Andi Puddicombe, Cofounder of Headspace
- When did you last time spent 10 minutes doing nothing?
- A harvard research paper published that we spend 47% of our times just thinking
- Having an uncalm mind leads to unhappiness and irrational decisions
- Mind is a precious thing still we do not look after it
- Doing nothing does not mean not having thoughts but recognizing that it is a thought and let it pass without judgement, without overthinking
- Too many times, we are just thinking about thinking, become anxious being anxious
- Meditation is scientifically proved technique still people do not practice it
- Meditation does not necessarily mean to sit on floor, it simply means to strike a balance between too much focus on a particular thought and no focus on something. In short, simple being present
- Being present is so underrated

## 15) How to find wonderful Ideas - Ok Go Band
- Ok Band is together since 1998 and is known for creating innovative videos
- If you are keen observant, ideas will find you
- When we get an idea, we make a plan, a great plan, do cost analysis but in the end could not implement it
- With every awesome idea, there are numerous moving parts 
- In one of this videos, he showed a video with 130 moving parts / pieces
- If the probability of each moving part to work right is 90%, then probability of your entire system would work is 1 in a million. If prob(moving part) is 99% then system function working prob is 27%.
- Speaker suggested that before implementation, we should identify moving parts and experiement with them in sandbox and then we know what happens when a part is tilted or modified a little.

## 14) Why Great leaders make you feel safe - Simon Sinek
- When recession hit in 2008, CEO of a big manufacturing company called a meeting to discuss layoffs. he believed in counting hearts and not counting heads. He said that instead of layoffs, every person from Secreatry to CEO will take unpaid 4 weeks mandatory leave. This increased morale of everyone. Instead of some people suffering a lot, let more people suffer a little. And people coordinated among themselves who could afford 5 week, compensated for people who wanted to take only 3 weeks. This saved the company 20 Million dollars.
- Captain of navy eat last and once food was over and he did not eat. When he reached the board, navy persons bring their own food for him.
- A great leader is like a great parent. We give our kid every opportunity to grow, fail, learn and try to make up for his mistakes.
- Another tech company in New York, their CEO said every employee is a permanent member and they won't be fired for performance issues. If you have issues with performance, we will give you coaching just like what we do with out kids. When they do not perform well, we try to help them instead of firing them.
- People love SouthWest Airlines because their employees do not fear their leaders and hence they love their job, they love the organization
- An organization is a place where people tend to share, collaborate, help each other.
- Once a sergent in Afghanistan saved his soldier's life and kissed his forehead and when speaker asked military persons why they did that? The anser is same - "Because they would do it for me".
- A great leader do not let his people suffer even if his numbers would have to suffer

## 13) Your elusive creative genius - Elizabeth Gilbert
- Author of "Eat, Pray & love"
- Ancient Greeks and Romans felt that there is some external power which gives creativity. Greeks used to call is daemons and Romans used to call it genius.
- A poet (90 years old) told the speaker that when she used to work in farms in early childhood, she used to feel like poems chasing her from landscapes and she ran to the house to take pen and paper and note them down. Sometimes they also got lost while she reaches home and sometimes she used to pull poem back from her other hand and in result the poem got written in reverse (bottom to top)
- Tom, singer once was driving through LA Freeway and he got a nice song. Instead of being disturbed by the fact he could not write it down, he did something unique, novel - He stopped, came out of car and pointed towards the sky and said Can't you see I am driving right now. Can you come at more opportune time ? If you really want to come right now, go bother someone else.
- This approach was also used by Speaker when she was writing "Eat, Pray & Love" book. In the middle of the work, she felt that this is going to be her worst project ever and she started feeling to dump the book but then she started talking to empty corner of the room and said Can't you see I am doing my best part ever and if this is going to be a failure, it will be a failure for both of us because you are not doing your job. And even this time, I am doing my job by saying to you to come up and do your part.
- A similar story was from North Africa Deserts where there used to be performance and once in a while one of the dancers get something on him and his performance used to feel divine and people start to chant "Allah, Allah, God, God" and when Spain invaded them, they took this custom with them and in bull fights and other performances, people call "Ole, Ole, Bravo, Genius" whenever something unusual happens.
- Moral of the talk is - "Do your job and you will get Ole nonetheless. And if you do not get Ole, even then do your job".

## 12) The brain benefits of deep sleep - Dan Gartenberg
- Showed 4 types of brain wave patterns
	* Waking
	* Normal Sleep
	* REM
	* Deep Sleep
- Waking wave patterns were very similar to brain wave patterns in REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep mode
- In deep sleep, there are bursts of waves with some frequency
- Dan along with Harvard medical research group created a device to produce sound patterns which match the frequency of wave patterns in deep sleep and it makes transition from rem sleep to deep sleep sooner
- Sleep affects the mental state of health and affects how you think, take decisions, stress level, productivity level etc
- Students who used the devices denied remembering the sounds from the device

## 11) Agile Programming for the families - Bruce Fieler
- Talked to more than 1000 families

- Checkbox is very strong and it is heaven for kids.
- 3 lessons from Bruce
	1. Adaptability: Ready to adapt in different situations, while making decisions. Be open mind and let best ideas win
	2. Empower your children: Allow them to make mistakes, evaluate them and work with them. More importanly give more focus on what they do right than what they do wrong
	3. Tell your Story
		* Research backs "Do you know" test in which you ask kids questions like do you know where were your grandparents born, where did your parents go to school, different hardships you faced in life and how you or other family members overcame hardships

## How to disagree productively, Julia Bhar
- Do not associate idea with a person
- Often when you discuss you get to understand the otherside of situation
- One of the tricks is to have better debate/discussion is to bring people on common ground first and then take from there

## Matthieu Ricard, The habits of happiness
- Mind training matters
- When we spend 15 years into education, spend a lot on our community and everything else to remain life happy and beautiful but not spend enough to train our mind which matters most
- When we are not happy from within, it does not matter what do we have. Even if we have flat on 100th floor most comfortable and most luxurious, we are only looking for a window to jump from.
- We can not have two opposite states of emotions - We cannot love/hate same person simultaneously

## Peter Johansson, Do you know what we do why we do?
- Conducted an experiment where a person is given two choices and person has to make a choice and explain it later
	* In some choices, speaker switched the choices when handed over the card to person
	* In most of the cases person did not catch that choice has been switched and yet explained why he liked that other choice
- Another experiement in Sweden where persons were asked questions about political party
	* Speaker asked the person to explain why he chose the opposite choice intentionally and that person in most of the times did explain.
	* Speaker was able to convert left people to right and right people to left after questionaire without them knowing
- Choice blindness
	* Ways in which people are blind to (not aware of) their own choices and preferences
	* We think we want A but when we are given B, we make up all kinds of reasons that would persuade us into believing that B is a much better alternative and how we actually wanted it all along.

## Lera Boroditsky, How languages shapes the way we think
- Humans have the leverage of language to communicate thoughts among each other
- Different languages trigger thoughts differently for same event
- A Picture with a person and vase falling
	- English: He broke the vase
	- Spanish: The vase broke
- It matters in case of eye witnesses but the way the fact is presented it changes the severity of crime and hence the nature of punishment
- Some languages do not have words for numbers like eight, seven etc so these people have difficulty in learning mathematics and performing some common actions
- Grammar based gender
	- Bridge is masculine in german while feminie in spanish (or vice-versa)
	- Germans would say bridges are strong, long (masculine words)
	- Spanish would say bridges are beautiful (feminine words)

			* People not treating as proper human being as giving credit card without looking at her
	* Observe master pieces around us

- When you are grateful, you tend to help others otherwise you are caught up in your own needs

## Liv Boeree, 3 Lessons from playing poker
- There are so many factors playing in your win so do not overestimate your skills for it
- There is always a probability of everything
- Do not use vague words like probably, sometimes. Try giving it certain probability

## Stacy Abrahams
- Why do I move forward because going back isn't an option and standing isn't enough
- Before doing anything, ask these questions
	- What do I want?
	- Why do I want it?
	- How do I get it?
- When there is a setback, go back to `why` to get motivated and start doing again
- Fatigue is an opportunity to evaluate how much I want it
- In case of fatigue, again back to `why` to get back to start again

## Dan Gilbert, Why do we make bad decisions?
- Bernaulli, a greek fellow gave a formula
	Decision Value = Odds of happening * Value of Gain
- Try the following questions
	* 50$ now vs 60$ now
	* 60$ now vs 60$ in a month
	* 50$ now vs 60$ in a month
- Answer to 1st and 2nd are quite straighforward but when we mix both of them, we get a difficult question
- People tend to pick 50$ now and think keeping them in bank will also get them interest 
- Another thing is the comparison shifting
	* Wine Bottles in the shelves 8$, 27$, 33$
	* We tend to buy neither most expensive nor most cheapest product
	* So retailers put one more wine bottle 8$, 27$, 33$, 51$ and in this case we will happily take 33$ wine
	* In both the cases, it has nothing to do with taste of wine when you bring it at home
- One more thing we try to put in is our past memories
	* A deal is 2000$ and now availble for 1600$. We will take it happily
	* A deal is 2000$ but went low to 700$ last week but now that is over and is now availble at 1200$. Most people won't take it although it is still a better deal but in this case we have some prior context to compare and based on that we will take decision.
- In short, We don't exist in 10000 years it is because of our own decisions because
	* We underestimated the odds of future pains and overestimated the value of present pleasures
