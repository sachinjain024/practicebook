Ted Talks
---------

With every afternoon meal, I watch 1-2 Ted talks to improve myself, learn from others and broaden my perspective for different things. Following is a post session summary I could find in my head or the most impressive things I found during the talk.

## 12) The brain benefits of deep sleep - Dan Gartenberg
- Showed 4 types of brain wave patterns
	* Waking 
	* Normal Sleep
	* REM
	* Deep Sleep
- Waking wave patterns were very similar to brain wave patterns in REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep mode
- In deep sleep, there are bursts of waves with some frequency
- Dan along with Harvard medical research group created a device to produce sound patterns which match the frequency of wave patterns in deep sleep and it makes transition from rem sleep to deep sleep sooner
- Sleep affects the mental state of health and affects how you think, take decisions, stress level, productivity level etc
- Students who used the devices denied remembering the sounds from the device

## 11) Agile Programming for the families - Bruce Fieler
- Talked to more than 1000 families
- In Hardvard Business Review 1986 article, someone found the new approach for working - Agile
- Quote: All happy families are alike, all unhappy families are unhappy in their own way
- Secret to make a happy family is TRY
	* Take small steps
	* Accumulate small wins
- Bruce started family conversation every sunday where they discussed what went well last week, and everyone threw ideas for what to do next week and they pick two items to focus on
- Checkbox is very strong and it is heaven for kids.
- 3 lessons from Bruce
	1. Adaptability: Ready to adapt in different situations, while making decisions. Be open mind and let best ideas win
	2. Empower your children: Allow them to make mistakes, evaluate them and work with them. More importanly give more focus on what they do right than what they do wrong
	3. Tell your Story
		* Research backs "Do you know" test in which you ask kids questions like do you know where were your grandparents born, where did your parents go to school, different hardships you faced in life and how you or other family members overcame hardships

## 10) Never ever give up - Diana Nyad
- Dyana Nyad swam from Cuba to Florida in 53 hours at age of 64
- She did it in her fifth attempt
- It is not what you get after achieving your dreams but what you become while achieving them
- It was a team effort
- Night was very dark, so black that you can't see your own hand. You can't turn on light as it attracts fish which attracts starks, jellyfish (poisnous)
- People aim for the stars, dyana was aiming for the horizon :-)

## 9) What makes a good life? Robert Waldinger
- When asked about the goals for 90% of millennials, they said they want to become rich
- Out of those 50% said they want to be famous
- Harvard Univerisy is doing research with approx 700 people in which they observe their life from childhood to old age and they see patterns of what leads happiness and sorrows
- Research is being carried out since 1938 and groups of two men including a group from underpriveleged area
- These guys take their medical reports, also video tape discussions with their family members 
- Research found that at the age of 50, those people were happy who had better relationships
	* Healthy relationship with friends, family or community
	* Healthy relationship leads to good healthy body as well as healthy mind

## How to disagree productively, Julia Bhar
- Do not associate idea with a person
- Often when you discuss you get to understand the otherside of situation
- One of the tricks is to have better debate/discussion is to bring people on common ground first and then take from there

## Matthieu Ricard, The habits of happiness
- Mind training matters
- When we spend 15 years into education, spend a lot on our community and everything else to remain life happy and beautiful but not spend enough to train our mind which matters most
- When we are not happy from within, it does not matter what do we have. Even if we have flat on 100th floor most comfortable and most luxurious, we are only looking for a window to jump from.
- We can not have two opposite states of emotions - We cannot love/hate same person simultaneously

## Peter Johansson, Do you know what we do why we do?
- Conducted an experiment where a person is given two choices and person has to make a choice and explain it later
	* In some choices, speaker switched the choices when handed over the card to person
	* In most of the cases person did not catch that choice has been switched and yet explained why he liked that other choice
- Another experiement in Sweden where persons were asked questions about political party
	* Speaker asked the person to explain why he chose the opposite choice intentionally and that person in most of the times did explain.
	* Speaker was able to convert left people to right and right people to left after questionaire without them knowing
- Choice blindness
	* Ways in which people are blind to (not aware of) their own choices and preferences
	* We think we want A but when we are given B, we make up all kinds of reasons that would persuade us into believing that B is a much better alternative and how we actually wanted it all along.

## Lera Boroditsky, How languages shapes the way we think
- Humans have the leverage of language to communicate thoughts among each other
- Different languages trigger thoughts differently for same event
- A Picture with a person and vase falling
	- English: He broke the vase
	- Spanish: The vase broke
- It matters in case of eye witnesses but the way the fact is presented it changes the severity of crime and hence the nature of punishment
- Some languages do not have words for numbers like eight, seven etc so these people have difficulty in learning mathematics and performing some common actions
- Grammar based gender
	- Bridge is masculine in german while feminie in spanish (or vice-versa)
	- Germans would say bridges are strong, long (masculine words)
	- Spanish would say bridges are beautiful (feminine words)

## AJ Jacobs, Journey to thank people involved in morning coffee
- Book: Thank a thousand
- Kid giving idea to thank people in person because they cannot see/hear thanks offered in the room
- Lessons from gratitude journey by saying thank you to everyone involved in coffee shop
	* Give attendtion to people when they talk to you
		- Story of a barista, Chung who was very pleasant and happy but had a difficult job sometimes
			* People expresses unhappiness including 9-year girl when she did a different design
			* People not treating as proper human being as giving credit card without looking at her
	* Observe master pieces around us
		- On/Off switch
		- Coffee lid
		- Chair
		- Think how many people put in how much efforts to bring this to you
	* Fake it till you feel it
- Behaviour change thoughts and thoughts change behaviour
- When you are grateful, you tend to help others otherwise you are caught up in your own needs

## Liv Boeree, 3 Lessons from playing poker
- There are so many factors playing in your win so do not overestimate your skills for it
- There is always a probability of everything
- Do not use vague words like probably, sometimes. Try giving it certain probability

## Stacy Abrahams
- Why do I move forward because going back isn't an option and standing isn't enough
- Before doing anything, ask these questions
	- What do I want?
	- Why do I want it?
	- How do I get it?
- When there is a setback, go back to `why` to get motivated and start doing again
- Fatigue is an opportunity to evaluate how much I want it
- In case of fatigue, again back to `why` to get back to start again

## Dan Gilbert, Why do we make bad decisions?
- Bernaulli, a greek fellow gave a formula
	Decision Value = Odds of happening * Value of Gain
- Try the following questions
	* 50$ now vs 60$ now
	* 60$ now vs 60$ in a month
	* 50$ now vs 60$ in a month
- Answer to 1st and 2nd are quite straighforward but when we mix both of them, we get a difficult question
- People tend to pick 50$ now and think keeping them in bank will also get them interest 
- Another thing is the comparison shifting
	* Wine Bottles in the shelves 8$, 27$, 33$
	* We tend to buy neither most expensive nor most cheapest product
	* So retailers put one more wine bottle 8$, 27$, 33$, 51$ and in this case we will happily take 33$ wine
	* In both the cases, it has nothing to do with taste of wine when you bring it at home
- One more thing we try to put in is our past memories
	* A deal is 2000$ and now availble for 1600$. We will take it happily
	* A deal is 2000$ but went low to 700$ last week but now that is over and is now availble at 1200$. Most people won't take it although it is still a better deal but in this case we have some prior context to compare and based on that we will take decision.
- In short, We don't exist in 10000 years it is because of our own decisions because
	* We underestimated the odds of future pains and overestimated the value of present pleasures
