100 Ted Talks Project (1st Jan 2019 - Ongoing)
---------------------------------------------

With every afternoon meal, I watch a Ted talk to improve myself, learn from others and broaden my perspective for different things. Following is a post session summary I could remember. The choice of the Talk is completely random.
Please refrain yourself from judging, making anything out of this summary (or even this place). 

**Read at your own risk**

## 2019.05.24 (31) Build Tower, Build Team - Tom Wujec
- Speaker gave marshmallow experiment to the team using sphagetti, tape and put marshmallow on the top
- Kids built taller structure than business graduates
	* Business graduates put a lot of time in planning and putting out the best structure and when the first structure fell there was no time to rebuild it
	* Kids built the structure quickly, learnt fromt he fall, iterated on it quickly and created another
	* Engineers and Architects did the best because they understand triangles and geometrical shapes
	* CEOs did above average (20 inches)
	* CEOs with executive did better than just CEOs
- In another experiment, speaker added 10K worth software as prize money and the performance dropped drastically and there was not a single structure produced
- He performed the same experiement with same group after 4 months and the results were dramatic. Groups did really well.
	* HighStakes + Low Skills = Low Success
	* HighStakes + High Skills = Good Success
- This also taught the importance of prototyping in any industry

## 2019.05.24 (30) Helping others make you happy but depends how you do it - Elizabeth Dunn
- Speaker's research was in this area but she hardly contributed to charity
- One day, she heard the news about Syria refugees and she wanted to help So she took out her credit card and filled all the details but she didnot feel any emotion about giving and making her happy
- Canada offered a program `Group of five` in which you can form a group of five and fly a family from Syria and fund for the next 1 year
- She participated in that with an organization and formed group of 25.
- She and her friends made all the arrangements and waited eagerly for the family at airport. It was a happy moment
- Another Incident, there was a restaurant which has a program that any organization can fund a dinner for homeless
- It gave an opportunity to the volunteers to sit and talk with the homeless people
- Some of the volunteers who changed their route earlier to avoid the area now started taking the route to say Hi to the familiar faces
- She found that when people donate to UNICEF (very big org) there is almost no change in people's emotions/happiness but when people donate to spreadthenet (org which donates net to avoid malaria) people really found happiness in giving
- It is really important to understand how your money is spent and what impact it created to give you happiness/pleasure
- If you are in charity, do not give back pens/calendars to the contributors intead give them the opportunity to find happiness

## 2019.05.17 (29) Sleep is your superpower - Matt Walker, Sleep Scientist
- Sleep is mother nature's best effort to prevent mortality
- We need sleep not only after learning but before learning too
	* Sleep (Deep Sleep) moves the learning into more stable and secure persistence
- An experiment was done between two groups - One with full 8 hours of sleep and other with barely 4-5 hours of sleep and the next day both groups were tested based on the learning ability.
	* Group 1 had 70% better learning than the other group
- Humans are the only species which keep them deprive of sleep
- Daylight savings effect
	* When day light savings take place, sleep gets reduced by 1 hour
	* It was observed that on the same day in spring there are more than 24% heart attacks
	* On the opposite that when autumn starts, heart attacks are reduced by 21% with just one more hour of sleep
- What we should do when we are awake at night and trying to sleep?
	* Wake up, Go to another room and come back when you are feeling sleepy again
	* You do not sit at dinner table waiting to be hungry
	* Brain needs to form the association back that bed is the place to sleep
- When we sleep, there are immune system cells which kills other unwanted cells in the body
	* So having a proper sleep increases our immunity system as well
- When we grow old, we see signs of weak memory, repeating things and also lesser sleep
	* Sleep is related to aging as well
- Two tips to improve your sleep

## 2019.05.15 (28) Why we ignore obvious problems - Michele Wucker
- Why do we often include big problems like financial crisis and climate change
- Before 2008 US Financial crisis, there was a guy whose job was just to watch for financial crisis but he could not predict
- After postmortem, conclusion was no one could predict the crisis
- Speaker sold her house in manhattan when it's price went double in 4 years
- Speaker coined the term "Gray Rhino" for any major problem
- She mentioned that she spent a lot of time in China and there is a difference in how WSJ, Washingon braodcast economic/financial news to citizens unlike China
- Both countries have different types of govt but have similar set of problems like inequality etc
- WSJ shows things as more smooth while China from journalists to President highlights the different crisis accurately
- Chinese Individuals are more likely to take good risks because they have (or believe) cushion from govt if things go wrong while in US, you have to go/do it alone
- Even if the problem is major like Climate change and an individual cannot solve it alone, attitude matters. You do your bit and the world follows.

## 2019.05.01 (27) How Twitter Needs to Change, Conv b/w Ted Staff (Chris Anderson, 1 more) and Jack Dorsey
- Gist of the conversation is how and what Twitter is doing to ensure healthy conversaion on Twitter. how does twitter handle harassments, racism comments etc
- JD says they are working to create a healthy conversation on Twitter
- Twitter is the best network to follow your interests. People can simply follow the hashtags or their interest groups or communities instead of picking people one by one. This is fundamental shift and hard to do.
- If he starts over, he may not interoduce like and follow button
- Initially, Follower Count was bold and strong and people on twitter tend to maximize these numbers and sometimes say outragious things etc.
- One year back, every comment which was reported was reviewed manually before taking it off
- Twitter invested heavily on machine learning and deep learning to scan the hate comments and move the comments to top to be reviewed manually
- Did partner with some lab in MIT to determine the initial factors of health of conversation
- Contd..

## 2019.04.25 (26) Nature is everywhere, We need to learn to see it - Emma Marris
- The whole point of talk was: How do we define nature?
- National Parks are heavily managed
- It takes a lot of cost and effort to make national parks look untouched
- Special efforts are done to protect endangered species
- Children do not enjoy national parks because there are so many restrictions
- When a survey was done with young people about going outdoors atleast once a week
	* 3 out of 5 stay inside
	* Most popular reason (61 percent) was that there was no natural place near their home to go
	* In US there is atleast one open park within 10 minutes of walking distance
- If we do not let our kids touch nature, play with them, make forts, they won't have any attachment to nature
- Nature is where multiple species thrive, grow after all humans are also a part of nature
- If we do not appreciate small areas outside our homes, small parks etc which is part of nature, we will lose them too
- Every environmentalist speaker knows had build a fort in their childhood so it is important that our kids build forts and touch the nature

## 2019.04.09 (25) What your breath could reveal about your health - Julian Burschka
- There are common diseases for deaths even in high income economies
- This is because the symptoms of diseases occur at much later stage and this is when treatment starts
- Our Breath consists of
	* Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon Dioxide, Argon, and other Compounds in very small percentage
- Alcohol detecter machines detects the presence of ethanol in the breath. I used to think that this machine works by checking the amount of power person can generate in blow of air. Ha :-)
- If we can detect the diseases using Breath Analysis, it would lead to proactive detection and treatment rather than reactive detection and treatment
- Such a solution would be
	* Simple 
	* Portable
	* Cheap, Accessible to All
	* Not affecting to health
- Challenges
	* Take Sampling of the breath particles
	* Insufficient data
	* Highly accurate sensors

## 2019.04.08 (24) How not to be ignorant about the world - Hans & Ola Rosling
- Speaker talks about how much we are ignorant about the world. Starts with 3 questions
	1. Number of deaths [doubled/halved/same] since 1900?

	3. Number of people moved poverty since 1980 [Halved/Same/Doubled]
- Swedish people had the most negative sentiment
- The Ignorance Project, Gapminder foundation
- Base case is 33% and considered as chimp's choice (random choice)
- Answers are
	1. More than halved. We are living in much more stable world right now
	2. Avg years is more than 7 so they are fast catching up
	3. Num of people in poverty has reduced a lot (More than half again)
- Problems for the negative sentiments
	* Biases
	* Teachers teach the outdated content to the kids
	* News
- There are 4 ways to improve the positivity (like rules of thumb)
	* Instead of thinking everything is getting worse, start thinking everything is getting improved
	* Instead of fearing from Dangers like Sharks/Terrorists which become a major highlights of news, think they does not affect you. They rarely kill very few people than other reasons like accident, alchohol etc

- She started a project - Boredom and Brilliance. A lot of people signed up for the 1-week challenges
- At the end of the challenge, on an average 6 minutes of screen time was reduced

	* Roads got developed in the process. Yes he made the cars before there were roads
	* Generated Jobs for thousands
- Similarly, there were other inventions which changed the situations
- Poverty is not due to lack of resources but lack of innovation
- A small change in perspective: How to increase prosperity? Answer is Innovation
- Building products which affect life of average people
- Innovation is simply practical,affordable,easy solutions to everyday problems

## 2019.03.25 (21) How to speak up for yourself - Adam Galinsky
- How should we decide when to speak up and when to not.

	* Speaker's brother works on documentary. When he got a good offer from a company, he advised his brother to negotiate and drafted a nice response but the company felt offended and revoked the offer.
- Sometimes, when we speak up we get punished and when we do not, we get unnoticed
- We should learn to take other's perspective, When we take other's perspective, we feel confident

## 2019.03.07 (20) Why I love a country that once betrayed me - George Takei

- Speaker read history and civics books to learn more about the imprisonment
- His father helped him learn the democracy - It is about the people. It can as good as good people in goveranance and can be as fallible as the bad guys. Democracy means governance by people.
- After the bombing of pearl harbour, young americans (including japanese americans) voluteered to fight for their country but instead japanese americans were sent to imprisonment
- When there was a shortage of man power in war, japanese american were asked to join and they did join to take their families out of prison and for their own country
- During a battle with Germany, they did not expect an attack from the opposite of a hill which was 1000 ft high and Americans were losing so the 442nd Unit (containing japanese americans) decided to hike the hill and attack from the back to surprise the germans

## 19) How to teach kids to talk about taboo topics - Liz Kleinrock
- Speaker is a classroom teacher of 4th grade students
- Once a kid asked - What is racism
- Another kid volunteered and answered white skin people do not respect dark skin people because the colour of their skin matches the color of poop
- Half of the class burst into laughter while the other half started making comments how can she say something like this. This is offensive.
 - Teacher had two options
 	* Fight: Scold the kid who answered and suppress her voice
 	* Flight: Change the subject
 - Both the options were bad for one or the other
 	* Fight is bad for Abby because she did not know what wrong she said and she will not gather courage to say something she knew next time
 	* Flight is bad for half of the class who laughed listeneing to word poop and may associate this in their later period of life
 - So, Instead she choose to explain the topic and the whole classes expressed interest in understanding it and why it is wrong
 - We should develop an ecosystem where kids should be free to make mistakes, learn from them and can communicate with each other about different things
 - We as adults should not be embarassed about not knowing something. If they ask something you don't know admit it and respond later

## 18) The meaning of work - Roy Bahat
- Startup Invester in AI field
- People with less than 150K salary said about the work
	* Dignity
	* Stability

- Future is already here. When ATM machines were installed, essentially it has replaced jobs for cash dispensers in banks but it has also created jobs in other domains
- Some people who work but are not get paid like caretakers, parents, housewives. They also deserve dignity.
- We need to stop associating dignity with paid jobs.
- Even 100 years from now in work we will need collaboration with others
- For some truck drivers, they have dignity because they are the ones bringing fruits, vegetables, newspapers to everyone in the city

## 17) Saving for tomorrow, tomorrow - Shlomo Benartzi
- An average american spends approx 1000 dollars every year on lotteries
- Primarily low income people spend more on lotteries than high salaried guys

- Organ Donation Example
	* In Germany people can select to donate organs when they fill DL and other forms. About 12% do
	* In Austria, people can select NOT to donate organs and about 1% do.
	* This means, Germany has ~12% donors while Austria has ~99% donors
	* This shows, the result of doing nothing. Procastination
- Banana vs Chocolate experiment
	* Given a choice of banana vs chocolate in an event next week, studies showed that 74% people preferred bananas but actually in the event 25-30% actually ate bananas. More people went with chocolate because of immediate gratification
- Money Apple Experiment
	* A group of monkeys is given an apple and they were really happy
	* Another group of monkeys is given two apples and one is taken away and they become really mad why the second one was taken away
	* Similarly, when we have received money it is difficult for us to avoid this and go to savings
	* Another challenge, notion of loss aversion. Somehow we feel that saving is some kind of loss for us
- Speaker and his friend (Richard Thaler) combined all these studies and results and created a scheme for financial planning
- They created Retirement Pension Plan according to which 3% additional amount will go to employee's savings whenever they get a pay raise.
- This inceased the amount of savings and people starting to save more.
- Lots of companies have adopted this scheme.

- A harvard research paper published that we spend 47% of our times just thinking
- Having an uncalm mind leads to unhappiness and irrational decisions
- Mind is a precious thing still we do not look after it
- Doing nothing does not mean not having thoughts but recognizing that it is a thought and let it pass without judgement, without overthinking
- Too many times, we are just thinking about thinking, become anxious being anxious
- Meditation is scientifically proved technique still people do not practice it
- Meditation does not necessarily mean to sit on floor, it simply means to strike a balance between too much focus on a particular thought and no focus on something. In short, simple being present
- Being present is so underrated

## 15) How to find wonderful Ideas - Ok Go Band
- Ok Band is together since 1998 and is known for creating innovative videos
- If you are keen observant, ideas will find you
- When we get an idea, we make a plan, a great plan, do cost analysis but in the end could not implement it
- With every awesome idea, there are numerous moving parts 
- In one of this videos, he showed a video with 130 moving parts / pieces
- If the probability of each moving part to work right is 90%, then probability of your entire system would work is 1 in a million. If prob(moving part) is 99% then system function working prob is 27%.
- Speaker suggested that before implementation, we should identify moving parts and experiement with them in sandbox and then we know what happens when a part is tilted or modified a little.

## 14) Why Great leaders make you feel safe - Simon Sinek
- When recession hit in 2008, CEO of a big manufacturing company called a meeting to discuss layoffs. he believed in counting hearts and not counting heads. He said that instead of layoffs, every person from Secreatry to CEO will take unpaid 4 weeks mandatory leave. This increased morale of everyone. Instead of some people suffering a lot, let more people suffer a little. And people coordinated among themselves who could afford 5 week, compensated for people who wanted to take only 3 weeks. This saved the company 20 Million dollars.
- Captain of navy eat last and once food was over and he did not eat. When he reached the board, navy persons bring their own food for him.
- A great leader is like a great parent. We give our kid every opportunity to grow, fail, learn and try to make up for his mistakes.
- Another tech company in New York, their CEO said every employee is a permanent member and they won't be fired for performance issues. If you have issues with performance, we will give you coaching just like what we do with out kids. When they do not perform well, we try to help them instead of firing them.
- People love SouthWest Airlines because their employees do not fear their leaders and hence they love their job, they love the organization

## 13) Your elusive creative genius - Elizabeth Gilbert
- Author of "Eat, Pray & love"
- Ancient Greeks and Romans felt that there is some external power which gives creativity. Greeks used to call is daemons and Romans used to call it genius.
- A poet (90 years old) told the speaker that when she used to work in farms in early childhood, she used to feel like poems chasing her from landscapes and she ran to the house to take pen and paper and note them down. Sometimes they also got lost while she reaches home and sometimes she used to pull poem back from her other hand and in result the poem got written in reverse (bottom to top)
- Tom, singer once was driving through LA Freeway and he got a nice song. Instead of being disturbed by the fact he could not write it down, he did something unique, novel - He stopped, came out of car and pointed towards the sky and said Can't you see I am driving right now. Can you come at more opportune time ? If you really want to come right now, go bother someone else.
- This approach was also used by Speaker when she was writing "Eat, Pray & Love" book. In the middle of the work, she felt that this is going to be her worst project ever and she started feeling to dump the book but then she started talking to empty corner of the room and said Can't you see I am doing my best part ever and if this is going to be a failure, it will be a failure for both of us because you are not doing your job. And even this time, I am doing my job by saying to you to come up and do your part.
- A similar story was from North Africa Deserts where there used to be performance and once in a while one of the dancers get something on him and his performance used to feel divine and people start to chant "Allah, Allah, God, God" and when Spain invaded them, they took this custom with them and in bull fights and other performances, people call "Ole, Ole, Bravo, Genius" whenever something unusual happens.
- Moral of the talk is - "Do your job and you will get Ole nonetheless. And if you do not get Ole, even then do your job".

## 12) The brain benefits of deep sleep - Dan Gartenberg
- Showed 4 types of brain wave patterns
	* Waking
	* Normal Sleep
	* REM
	* Deep Sleep
- Waking wave patterns were very similar to brain wave patterns in REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep mode
- In deep sleep, there are bursts of waves with some frequency
- Dan along with Harvard medical research group created a device to produce sound patterns which match the frequency of wave patterns in deep sleep and it makes transition from rem sleep to deep sleep sooner
- Sleep affects the mental state of health and affects how you think, take decisions, stress level, productivity level etc
- Students who used the devices denied remembering the sounds from the device

## 11) Agile Programming for the families - Bruce Fieler
- Talked to more than 1000 families

- 3 lessons from Bruce
	1. Adaptability: Ready to adapt in different situations, while making decisions. Be open mind and let best ideas win
	2. Empower your children: Allow them to make mistakes, evaluate them and work with them. More importanly give more focus on what they do right than what they do wrong
	3. Tell your Story
		* Research backs "Do you know" test in which you ask kids questions like do you know where were your grandparents born, where did your parents go to school, different hardships you faced in life and how you or other family members overcame hardships

## How to disagree productively, Julia Bhar
- Do not associate idea with a person
- Often when you discuss you get to understand the otherside of situation
- One of the tricks is to have better debate/discussion is to bring people on common ground first and then take from there

## Matthieu Ricard, The habits of happiness
- Mind training matters
- When we spend 15 years into education, spend a lot on our community and everything else to remain life happy and beautiful but not spend enough to train our mind which matters most
- When we are not happy from within, it does not matter what do we have. Even if we have flat on 100th floor most comfortable and most luxurious, we are only looking for a window to jump from.
- We can not have two opposite states of emotions - We cannot love/hate same person simultaneously

## Peter Johansson, Do you know what we do why we do?
- Conducted an experiment where a person is given two choices and person has to make a choice and explain it later
	* In some choices, speaker switched the choices when handed over the card to person
	* In most of the cases person did not catch that choice has been switched and yet explained why he liked that other choice
- Another experiement in Sweden where persons were asked questions about political party
	* Speaker asked the person to explain why he chose the opposite choice intentionally and that person in most of the times did explain.
	* Speaker was able to convert left people to right and right people to left after questionaire without them knowing
- Choice blindness
	* Ways in which people are blind to (not aware of) their own choices and preferences
	* We think we want A but when we are given B, we make up all kinds of reasons that would persuade us into believing that B is a much better alternative and how we actually wanted it all along.
	* https://explorable.com/choice-blindness

## Lera Boroditsky, How languages shapes the way we think
- Humans have the leverage of language to communicate thoughts among each other
- Different languages trigger thoughts differently for same event
- A Picture with a person and vase falling
	- English: He broke the vase
	- Spanish: The vase broke
- It matters in case of eye witnesses but the way the fact is presented it changes the severity of crime and hence the nature of punishment
- Some languages do not have words for numbers like eight, seven etc so these people have difficulty in learning mathematics and performing some common actions
- Grammar based gender
	- Bridge is masculine in german while feminie in spanish (or vice-versa)
	- Germans would say bridges are strong, long (masculine words)
	- Spanish would say bridges are beautiful (feminine words)

- There is always a probability of everything
- Do not use vague words like probably, sometimes. Try giving it certain probability

## Stacy Abrahams
- Why do I move forward because going back isn't an option and standing isn't enough
- Before doing anything, ask these questions
	- What do I want?
	- Why do I want it?
	- How do I get it?
- When there is a setback, go back to `why` to get motivated and start doing again
- Fatigue is an opportunity to evaluate how much I want it
- In case of fatigue, again back to `why` to get back to start again

## Dan Gilbert, Why do we make bad decisions?
- Bernaulli, a greek fellow gave a formula
	Decision Value = Odds of happening * Value of Gain
- Try the following questions
	* 50$ now vs 60$ now
	* 60$ now vs 60$ in a month
	* 50$ now vs 60$ in a month
- Answer to 1st and 2nd are quite straighforward but when we mix both of them, we get a difficult question
- People tend to pick 50$ now and think keeping them in bank will also get them interest 
- Another thing is the comparison shifting
	* Wine Bottles in the shelves 8$, 27$, 33$
	* We tend to buy neither most expensive nor most cheapest product
	* So retailers put one more wine bottle 8$, 27$, 33$, 51$ and in this case we will happily take 33$ wine
	* In both the cases, it has nothing to do with taste of wine when you bring it at home
- One more thing we try to put in is our past memories
	* A deal is 2000$ and now availble for 1600$. We will take it happily
	* A deal is 2000$ but went low to 700$ last week but now that is over and is now availble at 1200$. Most people won't take it although it is still a better deal but in this case we have some prior context to compare and based on that we will take decision.
- In short, We don't exist in 10000 years it is because of our own decisions because
	* We underestimated the odds of future pains and overestimated the value of present pleasures
