Ted Talks
---------

With every afternoon meal, I watch 1-2 Ted talks to improve myself, learn from others and broaden my perspective for different things. Following is a post session summary I could find in my head or the most impressive things I found during the talk.

## Lera Boroditsky, How languages shapes the way we think
- Humans have the leverage of language to communicate thoughts among each other
- Different languages trigger thoughts differently for same event
- A Picture with a person and vase falling
	- English: He broke the vase
	- Spanish: The vase broke
- It matters in case of eye witnesses but the way the fact is presented it changes the severity of crime and hence the nature of punishment
- Some languages do not have words for numbers like eight, seven etc so these people have difficulty in learning mathematics and performing some common actions
- Grammar based gender
	- Bridge is masculine in german while feminie in spanish (or vice-versa)
	- Germans would say bridges are strong, long (masculine words)
	- Spanish would say bridges are beautiful (feminine words)

## AJ Jacobs, Journey to thank people involved in morning coffee
- Book: Thank a thousand
- Kid giving idea to thank people in person because they cannot see/hear thanks offered in the room
- Lessons from gratitude journey by saying thank you to everyone involved in coffee shop
	* Give attendtion to people when they talk to you
		- Story of a barista, Chung who was very pleasant and happy but had a difficult job sometimes
			* People expresses unhappiness including 9-year girl when she did a different design
			* People not treating as proper human being as giving credit card without looking at her
	* Observe master pieces around us
		- On/Off switch
		- Coffee lid
		- Chair
		- Think how many people put in how much efforts to bring this to you
	* Fake it till you feel it
- Behaviour change thoughts and thoughts change behaviour
- When you are grateful, you tend to help others otherwise you are caught up in your own needs

## Liv Boeree, 3 Lessons from playing poker
- There are so many factors playing in your win so do not overestimate your skills for it
- There is always a probability of everything
- Do not use vague words like probably, sometimes. Try giving it certain probability

## Stacy Abrahams
- Why do I move forward because going back isn't an option and standing isn't enough
- Before doing anything, ask these questions
	- What do I want?
	- Why do I want it?
	- How do I get it?
- When there is a setback, go back to `why` to get motivated and start doing again
- Fatigue is an opportunity to evaluate how much I want it
- In case of fatigue, again back to `why` to get back to start again

## Dan Gilbert, Why do we make bad decisions?
- Bernaulli, a greek fellow gave a formula
	Decision Value = Odds of happening * Value of Gain
- Try the following questions
	* 50$ now vs 60$ now
	* 60$ now vs 60$ in a month
	* 50$ now vs 60$ in a month
- Answer to 1st and 2nd are quite straighforward but when we mix both of them, we get a difficult question
- People tend to pick 50$ now and think keeping them in bank will also get them interest 
- Another thing is the comparison shifting
	* Wine Bottles in the shelves 8$, 27$, 33$
	* We tend to buy neither most expensive nor most cheapest product
	* So retailers put one more wine bottle 8$, 27$, 33$, 51$ and in this case we will happily take 33$ wine
	* In both the cases, it has nothing to do with taste of wine when you bring it at home
- One more thing we try to put in is our past memories
	* A deal is 2000$ and now availble for 1600$. We will take it happily
	* A deal is 2000$ but went low to 700$ last week but now that is over and is now availble at 1200$. Most people won't take it although it is still a better deal but in this case we have some prior context to compare and based on that we will take decision.
- In short, We don't exist in 10000 years it is because of our own decisions because
	* We underestimated the odds of future pains and overestimated the value of present pleasures
