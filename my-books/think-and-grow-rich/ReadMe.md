## Definite Purpose

### Illinois Institute of Technology
- Dr Gunsalus was thinking for creating a university where much focus will be on practicals instead of theories
- For that he needed 1M dollars and he wanted to raise that money
- One day, he thought thinking is done and now is the time for some action. At that moment, he started having feeling that he is already in possession of money. He realized why he did not do it 2 years
- He called newspaper and said he will deliver a sermon(lecture) on what he would do if he has 1M$ hoping someone would listen to his plans and may fund his plans
- He prepared the sermon but forgot somewhere but he actually delivered it from his subconscious mind and he got funding by Philips Armor and he created Armor Institute of Technology later renamed to Illinois

## Organized Planning

### Applying for Job
- Forget if there is any opening in the company or not. Mention what you can offer to the prospective employer. 
- A Salesperson groom himself with care and he knows the first impressions are lasting
- If your resume is satisfying, you already get some advantage
