## How to avoid these four villians of decision making

    WRAP Process

1. Widen your options: Adds more options
2. Reality test your assumptions: Practically test your options
3. Attain distance before deciding: Out of selected options, which option works for you
4. Prepare to be wrong: How to handle if the selected option goes wrong

## WRAP
	- Widen Your options
		1. MultiTracking
		2. Opportunity Cost
		3. Vanishing Options test
			- To figure out if you are not missing an important choice
		4. Laddering 
			- Example - Increase your sales
			- Find our your best spots
			- Jump to next step and see different things your neighboring stores are doing
			- How retail stores can increase sales in your country
			- How other different category stores can increase sales 
			- Remember the example of how walmart reduced the checkout hassle using the laddering process
	- Reality test your assumptions
		1. Find persons who have solved this problem before
		2. Consider the opposite
			- What you'd do if you are on other side of line.
			- Ask discomforting questions 
		3. Ooch
			- Try iit for sometime and see if it really works
	- Attain distance before deciding
		1. What would your friend/successor do in this situation ?
		2. Zoom out and zoom in
			- Zoom out: Try to see the situation from an external perspective
			- Zoom in: Get more details on the situations
			- Repeat above 2
		3. Remember your core prioritites 
			- Are your core priorities to increase your sales or onbard a specific customer ?
		4. 10-10-10 step
			- How would you feel about this decision 10 seconds from now, 10 months from now and 10 years from now.
	- Prepare to be wrong
		1. Set a tripwire for decisions which doesn't have finite boundaries
		2. Bookend the future
			- For estimating share price, do not go with a rough value, it is like giving a range based on best and worst situations

## Widen your Options (W)

### Prevention Focus and Promotional Focus
- Prevention Focus: Avoid anything bad
- Promotional Focus: Take responsilbility/lead/charge
- Recent series of activities/events (Your mindset) impacts your decision
- Both are important
- Study about a women working in stressful job condition.
- Study about Staples and Office depot reacted to recession.
- this vs that - Better is choice is both
- Try to choose AND not OR

### What to do when you are unable to expand your options ?
- Vanishing Options test
	- Try to think what else you can do when you do not have currently available options.

### Alarming "whether or not" situations ?

Q1. "whether" I should leave the job ?
Q2. "whether" I should take divorce ?

Answer: Try to think to change the situation
- Try to talk to your boss for different set of duties
- Try to talk to your partner on ways to improve your relationship

## Reality Test your Assumptions (R)
- Most acquisitions go bad due to CEO hubris (self confidence, giving importance to oneself) (Case of confirmation bias)
- On an avg they pay 41% higher premium for acquisitions and research showed three factors which affect the price a CEO buys another company:
	- Praise by media
	- Past progress
	- High salary
- Antedote to hubris is showing disagreement in decision
- Often many companies do not obtain any thridparty or independent viewpoint
- Someone opened a new restaruant in your neighbourboog with your fav food and have few 4 star reviews and couple of 1 star ratings. Which one would you read. High chances are your would read 4 star ones because you want the restaurant to be great. Classical example of confirmation bias.


- We learn assessing the options to deal with confirmation bias
- confirmation bias is hunting for information which confirms our hypothesis or biasness

### Consider the opposite
- Ask discomforing questions
- e.g. What are the problems in this ?
- e.g. How many lawyers have exited the firm in last 5 years ?
