## Startup School Notes

01 - How and Why to Start a Startup - Sam Altman
-------------------------------------------

## Cofounders
- Cofounder is really important but he must be someone who is determined and you have a shared history
- Sepcific skills least matter (Determinism > Aptitude > Specific Skills)

## Users
- Build a product which is really loved by small number of users instead of product with lot many features but used once or twice
- Start with someone you already know and if it is a paid product, charge them
- "User Interviews" are really important
- Identify a set of users who would enjoy using your product and send them an email
- In the early days, do not look at absolute number of users but look at how many users are coming back and how often are they using it

03 - Metrics and Importance of Measurement - Adam D'Angelo, Quora
-----------------------------------------------------------------
- Q. Why did Jeff Bezos start with Books ?
- A. Differentiator. He wanted to start with something that is easy to start with while other competitors could not. Much varieties, lesser investment etc. It may apply to small number of people but those people really use your product than anything else.

- Cohort Analysis
	- Users who started using your product in the first week of launch and then still using it
- It is really important to track
	- User Renention
	- Growth Rate (It should be exponential)
- Uber, Facebook, Whatsapp etc have really good cohorts
- If user uninstalls your product after using for sometime, it is not a good sign
- Groupon, PokemonGo ended up being fad. 
- A lot of companies do not track metrics
- Companies must be very serious about metrics
- Metrics can be a painful reality

Finding the Product Market Fit (Peter Reinhardt)
------------------------------------------------
- 80% of the startups fail because they fail to find the product market fit
- They don't talk to customers
- Eventual process is to talk to customers and solve their one problem and then they will bring another problem and another problem and so on..
- Saastr founder has good answers on quora about software as service
- Read Lean Startup Book
- Explained idea about giving feedback to professors by clicking on a button. Founders imagined a vision but bringing laptop in front of students was the most distracting thing for them. Idea failed miserably.
- Right market fit is like standing on a mine
- Customers start following you and want to run with your product even if it not ready
- When talking to customers
	- Dig deep and try to find the problems and zoom into the area where you are building or thinking to build the solution
	- Do not sell your product immediately, Instead listen and understand the problems crystal clear
- segment.com (analytics.js): Sends data to multiple channels.
- Marketer can just select where data should go (Something similar to tag manager)
- Learn to differentiate when people just being nice and when actually need your solution.


How to build and manage teams (Vinod Khosla)
--------------------------------------------
- Gene Pool Engineering
	- When you start a company, identify a list of risk areas due to which your company can fail
	- Identify 3-5 other companies have solved that problem
	- identify 3-5 names from each companies who can help you mitigate that risk
	- Now, you know whom to hire
- Startups is all about risk management
- Most of the startups don't do which they planned initially so hire the people who stay relevant even if you have to pivot
