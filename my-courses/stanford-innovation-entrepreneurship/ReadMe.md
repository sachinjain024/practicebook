- Good leaders know the strengths and weeknesses of the people led by them and they know how to make most out of it.
	* A person refused to talk to Isaac Waldersen and ended up working with Steve Job for a decade
	* He said that people can call Steve jerk and so on but one think you can not take away from him is the ability to identify the strengths and weeknesses of people and that's a rare gift.
- Leader's Reflection
	* Layoff Example
		- A Company was facing difficult situation through 2008 financial issues. An employee walked to her boss and asked when was the layoff coming. He said you are right layoff are coming but how do you know? 
		- She responded that whenever there is a bad news you look at your shoes instead of looking in the eyes
		- This shows that people notice the attitude, behaviours of their leaders more than they notice themselves
	* Scarf Example
		- An employee was promoted to a higher position in BAE systems and she bought scarves for the next week to feel good on a new day with a new position
		- The very next week she noticed that a lot of female employees were wearing the scarves
		- This again shows that people notice and imitate the leader's attitude
	* Primate Example
		- A study showed that Monkeys look at their leaders every 20-30s.
- Cookie Test
	* Power Poisoning (3 indicators)
		- Focus more on yourself
		- Focus less on others
		- Rules don't apply to them
	* In a psychological experiment, Psychologists always lies to the participants. In such an experiment, three students were formed and two students were given social problems like how to fix litter problem etc and the third student was asked to evaluate the ideas by these two groups (essentially a little bit more power)
 	* Then a plate with 5 cookies were brought in the room. Usually, people are hesitant to take up the last cookieSo it was interesting to see who takes the 4th cookie. 
 	* It was found that in power student not only took the 4th cookie but also the last one and he also ate with mouth open and leaving more crumbs.
 	* An example of power poisoning - Focus on yourself, less on others, break the rules.
