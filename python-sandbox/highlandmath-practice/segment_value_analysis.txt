Analysis - Segment Value by Revenue of Individual Keywords present in Segment Name
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this problem statement, we will discuss the pros and cons for defining the segment value using the revenue for each keyword present in segment name.
This approach provides a simplistic model to determine the segment value.
Segment name is a very specific string and contain important keywords only so it strongly suggests that keywords in segment name contribute to segment value.
Unlike products/restaurants/others' reviews (or other statements) which may contain sentiments, sarcasms etc, segment name contains high density keywords
each of which contribute more or less to segment value. Therefore it makes sense to derive segment value by keywords revenue.
Using this approach we can get a general sense of segments and their value.

Please note the previous statement mentions general sense because this approach has some limitations.
When we take individual keywords and their contribution, we are ignoring the correlation between the keywords.
For example, if we talk about rent for house in general

    LakeSide - 2000$/month
    TwoGates - 1500$/month
    But, the rent for LakeSide and TwoGates house will be more than 3500$/month

The same concept applies here. In order to consider the correlation between the keywords we have to build a complex model with new dimensions as combination of those keywords.
Similarly, when we combine two keywords whose individual values are high but together the segment value could be less.
For example

    OnlineShoppers, Kids each could their individual values but Kids who are OnlineShoppers this segment is less likely to have a greater value than individual keywords
